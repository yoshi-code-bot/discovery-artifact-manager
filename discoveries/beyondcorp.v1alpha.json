Supported filter fields: * `type` * `category` * `subCategory` Examples: * \"category = application AND type = count\" * \"category = application AND subCategory = iap\" * \"type = status\" Allowed values: * type: [count, latency, status, list] * category: [application, device, request, security] * subCategory: [iap, webprotect] NOTE: Only equality based comparison is allowed. Only `AND` conjunction is allowed. NOTE: The 'AND' in the filter field needs to be in capital letters only. NOTE: Just filtering on `subCategory` is not allowed. It should be passed in with the parent `category` too. (These expressions are based on the filter language described at https://google.aip.dev/160).",

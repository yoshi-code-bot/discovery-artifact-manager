For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check to see whether the original operation was received. If it was, the server ignores the second request. This behavior prevents clients from mistakenly creating duplicate commitments.

A `role` is a named list of permissions; each `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created custom role.

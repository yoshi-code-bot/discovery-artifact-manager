If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check to see whether the original operation was received. If it was, the server ignores the second request. This behavior prevents clients from mistakenly creating duplicate commitments. The request ID must be a valid UUID, with the exception that zero UUID is not supported (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000)."

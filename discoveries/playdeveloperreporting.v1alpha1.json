For basic filter guidance, please check: https://google.aip.dev/160. **Supported functions:** * `activeBetween(startTime, endTime)`: If specified, only list anomalies that were active in between `startTime` (inclusive) and `endTime` (exclusive). Both parameters are expected to conform to an RFC-3339 formatted string (e.g. `2012-04-21T11:30:00-04:00`). UTC offsets are supported. Both `startTime` and `endTime` accept the special value `UNBOUNDED`, to signify intervals with no lower or upper bound, respectively. Examples: * `activeBetween(\"2021-04-21T11:30:00Z\", \"2021-07-21T00:00:00Z\")` * `activeBetween(UNBOUNDED, \"2021-11-21T00:00:00-04:00\")` * `activeBetween(\"2021-07-21T00:00:00-04:00\", UNBOUNDED)`",

Example: `apiLevel = 28 OR apiLevel = 29`. * `versionCode`: Matches error reports that occurred in the requested app version codes only.

The string representation consists of an optional sign, `+` (`U+002B`) or `-` (`U+002D`), followed by a sequence of zero or more decimal digits (\"the integer\"), optionally followed by a fraction, optionally followed by an exponent. An empty string **should** be interpreted as `0`. The fraction consists of a decimal point followed by zero or more decimal digits. The string must contain at least one digit in either the integer or the fraction. The number formed by the sign, the integer and the fraction is referred to as the significand. The exponent consists of the character `e` (`U+0065`) or `E` (`U+0045`) followed by one or more decimal digits. Services **should** normalize decimal values before storing them by: - Removing an explicitly-provided `+` sign (`+2.5` -\u003e `2.5`). - Replacing a zero-length integer value with `0` (`.5` -\u003e `0.5`). - Coercing the exponent character to upper-case, with explicit sign (`2.5e8` -\u003e `2.5E+8`). - Removing an explicitly-provided zero exponent (`2.5E0` -\u003e `2.5`). Services **may** perform additional normalization based on its own needs and the internal decimal implementation selected, such as shifting the decimal point and exponent value together (example: `2.5E-1` \u003c-\u003e `0.25`). Additionally, services **may** preserve trailing zeroes in the fraction to indicate increased precision, but are not required to do so. Note that only the `.` character is supported to divide the integer and the fraction; `,` **should not** be supported regardless of locale. Additionally, thousand separators **should not** be supported. If a service does support them, values **must** be normalized. The ENBF grammar is: DecimalString = '' | [Sign] Significand [Exponent]; Sign = '+' | '-'; Significand = Digits '.' | [Digits] '.' Digits; Exponent = ('e' | 'E') [Sign] Digits; Digits = { '0' | '1' | '2' | '3' | '4' | '5' | '6' | '7' | '8' | '9' }; Services **should** clearly document the range of supported values, the maximum supported precision (total number of digits), and, if applicable, the scale (number of digits after the decimal point), as well as how it behaves when receiving out-of-bounds values. Services **may** choose to accept values passed as input even when the value has a higher precision or scale than the service supports, and **should** round the value to fit the supported scale. Alternatively, the service **may** error with `400 Bad Request` (`INVALID_ARGUMENT` in gRPC) if precision would be lost. Services **should** error with `400 Bad Request` (`INVALID_ARGUMENT` in gRPC) if the service receives a value outside of the supported range."

      "description": "Singleton resource representing the set of error report metrics. This metric set contains un-normalized error report counts. **Supported aggregation periods:** * DAILY: metrics are aggregated in calendar date intervals. The default and only supported timezone is `America/Los_Angeles`. **Supported metrics:** * `errorReportCount` (`google.type.Decimal`): Absolute count of individual error reports that have been received for an app. * `distinctUsers` (`google.type.Decimal`): Count of distinct users for which reports have been received. Care must be taken not to aggregate this count further, as it may result in users being counted multiple times. **Required dimension:** This dimension must be always specified in all requests in the `dimensions` field in query requests. * `reportType` (string): the type of error. The value should correspond to one of the possible values in ErrorType. **Supported dimensions:** * `apiLevel` (string): the API level of Android that was running on the user's device. * `versionCode` (int64): version of the app that was running on the user's device. * `deviceModel` (string): unique identifier of the user's device model. * `deviceType` (string): identifier of the device's form factor, e.g., PHONE. * `issueId` (string): the id an error was assigned to. The value should correspond to the `{issue}` component of the issue name. * `deviceRamBucket` (int64): RAM of the device, in MB, in buckets (3GB, 4GB, etc.). * `deviceSocMake` (string): Make of the device's primary system-on-chip, e.g., Samsung. [Reference](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/Build#SOC_MANUFACTURER) * `deviceSocModel` (string): Model of the device's primary system-on-chip, e.g., \"Exynos 2100\". [Reference](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/Build#SOC_MODEL) * `deviceCpuMake` (string): Make of the device's CPU, e.g., Qualcomm. * `deviceCpuModel` (string): Model of the device's CPU, e.g., \"Kryo 240\". * `deviceGpuMake` (string): Make of the device's GPU, e.g., ARM. * `deviceGpuModel` (string): Model of the device's GPU, e.g., Mali. * `deviceGpuVersion` (string): Version of the device's GPU, e.g., T750. * `deviceVulkanVersion` (string): Vulkan version of the device, e.g., \"4198400\". * `deviceGlEsVersion` (string): OpenGL ES version of the device, e.g., \"196610\". * `deviceScreenSize` (string): Screen size of the device, e.g., NORMAL, LARGE. * `deviceScreenDpi` (string): Screen density of the device, e.g., mdpi, hdpi. **Required permissions**: to access this resource, the calling user needs the _View app information (read-only)_ permission for the app. **Related metric sets:** * vitals.errors.counts contains normalized metrics about Crashes, another stability metric. * vitals.errors.counts contains normalized metrics about ANRs, another stability metric.",

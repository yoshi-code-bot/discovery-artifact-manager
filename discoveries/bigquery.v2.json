For the purposes of idempotency ensured by the request_id, a request is considered duplicate of another only if they have the same request_id and are actually duplicates. When determining whether a request is a duplicate of the previous request, all parameters in the request that may affect the behavior are considered. For example, query, connection_properties, query_parameters, use_legacy_sql are parameters that affect the result and are considered when determining whether a request is a duplicate, but properties like timeout_ms don't affect the result and are thus not considered. Dry run query requests are never considered duplicate of another request. 4. When a duplicate mutating query request is detected, it returns: a. the results of the mutation if it completes successfully within the timeout. b. the running operation if it is still in progress at the end of the timeout. 5.

If none of the listed types supports the precision and the scale, the type supporting the widest range in the specified list is picked, and if a value exceeds the supported range when reading the data, an error will be thrown. Example: Suppose the value of this field is [\"NUMERIC\", \"BIGNUMERIC\"]. If (precision,scale) is: (38,9) -\u003e NUMERIC; (39,9) -\u003e BIGNUMERIC (NUMERIC cannot hold 30 integer digits); (38,10) -\u003e BIGNUMERIC (NUMERIC cannot hold 10 fractional digits); (76,38) -\u003e BIGNUMERIC; (77,38) -\u003e BIGNUMERIC (error if value exeeds supported range).
